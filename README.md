## ðŸŽ¨ **Design Philosophy**

The interface now feels like logging into a professional investment account (similar to Robinhood, Wealthfront) rather than a marketing chatbot. Key improvements:

- Professional color scheme with investment-focused UI
- Real-time portfolio data display
- Financial terminology and data presentation
- Clean, modern fintech aesthetic

## ðŸš€ **Usage**

1. Open `chatbot-standalone.html` in a browser
2. Click "Start Managing Your Portfolio" 
3. Try the investment-focused sample questions
4. Experience the professional investment assistant interface

## ðŸ”§ **Configuration**

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key
- `NOTION_TOKEN`: Your Notion integration token  
- `NOTION_DATABASE_ID_WAITLIST`: Your Notion database ID

The system automatically detects context and switches between marketing and investment assistant modes based on the `context` parameter sent to the API.
